  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

  <h2>
    Can I use ShareX to upload?
  </h2>
  <p>Sure thing! Here's the config: <a href="/QuadFile.json">i am link</a></p>
  <p>Import that as a custom uploader and fire away</p>

  <h2>
    Is this a pomf clone?
  </h2>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p>We have zero relation to pomf's codebase. QuadFile also started before pomf.se died.</p>

  <h2>
    Can I upload using my phone?
  </h2>
  <p>Sure, go ahead. You might even want to <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename="AddToHomescreen.png") }}">add {{ page.title }} to your homescreen</a>.</p>

  <h2>
    Who runs this thing
  </h2>
  <p>A guy called Quad (<a href="http://quad.moe">Website</a>)</p>

  <h2>
    What powers this site?
  </h2>
  <p>Purely Python powered and only depends on Flask. The database is SQLite, works alright on SSD.</p>
  <p>There is also a lot of coffee involved.</p>

  <h2>
    Is QuadFile open-source?
  </h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/QuadPiece/QuadFile">Yes.</a></p>
  
  <h2>
    Is my data safe?
  </h2>
  <p>Don't rely on our availability. This site isn't intended for storage or critial use. Mostly just to send files to friends.</p>
  <p>If you're asking in regards to privacy. Check the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> for details</p>
  
  <h2>
    What is your logo supposed to be?
  </h2>
  <p>It's nothing. But if you really need an excuse let's just say that it's a black meteor to represents downloads.</p>

  <h2>
    Will you add the ability to do X?
  </h2>
  <p>Probably not, this project is pretty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>. I'm trying to keep it as low-maintenance as possible while still satisfying 95% of the users.</p>

  <h2>
    What about the old files I uploaded?
  </h2>
  <p>All files from the old {{ page.title }} are still accessible, with the same URLs even.</p>
  
  <h2>
    Your site seems to be blacklisted
  </h2>
  <p>Golly, that's not good. Please contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/QuadPiece">Twitter</a> or by E-mail at <a href="mailto:contact@quad.moe">contact@quad.moe</a> so I can take a look at it.</p>
  <p>It would also help if you yourself contacted the application/company that blacklisted it and tell them that it is indeed safe. (Companies who sell firewalls and such are far more likely to listen to the customers who pay them, rather than the admins from sites they've blocked. Your voice is 10x as powerful as mine in situations like these)</p>

  <h2>
    Where can I donate?
  </h2>
  <p>You can't.</p>
